      "\n",
      "1.  *Test with simplified data.*\n",
      "    Before doing statistics on a real data set,\n",

      "    if we're looking at the effects of climate change on speciation,\n",

      "4.  *Check conservation laws.*\n",
      "    Mass, energy, and other quantitites are conserved in physical systems,\n",
      "    so they should be in programs as well.\n",
      "    Similarly,\n",

      "    the number of records should either stay the same or decrease\n",
      "    as we move from one analysis to the next\n",
      "    (since we might throw away outliers or records with missing values).\n",
      "    If \"new\" patients start appearing out of nowhere as we move through our pipeline,\n",
      "    it's probably a sign that something is wrong.\n",
